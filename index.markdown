Educating novices in the art of game design is a key challenge in computer science education. To develop their skills, novices need feedback to understand the impact of changes to digital game prototypes. However, game design tools lack intuitive mechanisms for visualizing how changes affect dynamics and gameplay. As a result, forming mental models about cause-and-effect relationships is hard, and learning how to program can be tedious and frustrating. The Live Game Design workshop 
{% endcomment %}
**The Live Game Design workshop** brings together researchers, practitioners, and educators who develop and apply game design tools. Together, we explore how better tools can empower creators, accelerate prototyping, support education, and make design more engaging, intuitive, and live.

Topics include:
* Applying game design and development tools in practice.
* Teaching game design and digital prototyping to students and novices.
* Creating live, AI-assisted, and visual programming tools for game design.

# Venue
The Live Game Design workshop is co-located with the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 2025), organized in Vienna and Graz. [http://fdg2025.org](http://fdg2025.org)
* **Date:** April 15th 2025

# Activities
The workshop will host three types of activities.

1. **Keynote.**
Our keynote speaker is Joris Dormans, the founder of Ludomotion.
Joris will provide an industry perspective on tools for game design and development.
*More details to follow.*

2. **Live Demo.**
Learn to use Vie, a powerful tool for rapid game prototyping
that provides real-time feedback on game mechanics. 
Create your own prototype and playtest it live!
