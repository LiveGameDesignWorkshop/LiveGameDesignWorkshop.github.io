**FDG2025** | **1st Workshop on Live Game Design, April 15 2025** | **Vienna & Graz, Austria**

**Live Game Design** has the potential to provide powerful, accessible, and standardized solutions for authoring, prototyping, and playtesting games for everyone. However, currently, design tools still lack intuitive user interfaces and real-time feedback mechanisms for rapid design iterations. Designers of all experience levels need immediate feedback and suggestions (feed-forward) on how changes to rules and content affect and improve dynamics and gameplay.

**The Live Game Design workshop** brings together researchers, designers, and educators who develop, apply, and teach these tools. Together, we will explore how better tools can empower creators, accelerate prototyping, support education, and make game design more engaging, intuitive, and alive. The workshop will feature an industry keynote by Joris Dormans, a hands-on mini game jam suitable for beginners, and an interactive panel discussion.

# Venue
The Live Game Design workshop is co-located with the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 2025), held in Vienna and Graz. More details: [http://fdg2025.org](http://fdg2025.org)
* **Venue:**  University of Vienna (Universität Wien), Hauptgebäude
* **Date:** Tuesday April 15th 2025
* **Time:** 10:30 - 12:00
* **Room:** Erika-Weinzierl-Saal

# Activities
The workshop will host three types of activities.

**Bio.** Joris Dormans is the founder of indie game company Ludomotion that is renowned for its state-of-the-art content generation in its roguelike-ish titles Unexplored 1 and 2. One day a week he stays in touch with his academic roots as an assistant professor involved with the Game Studies minor at the humanities department of Leiden University. 

**Generative Progress.** Since I decided to favor indie game development over a predominantly academic career almost 10 years ago, I have had the opportunity to put all those fancy content generation techniques into practice. Looking back at those years of development I am surprised how little I changed to the core techniques. At the same time, I have become much more bold in the way I am using the techniques. Over the years I have found that, when leveraged in the right way, the value of content generation is in its affordance for radically different game designs.

## 2. **Mini Game Jam**

Join this beginner-friendly mini game jam on Live Game Design. Experiment with Vie: a powerful tool for rapid 2D game prototyping that provides real-time feedback on game mechanics. After a brief demo, you can design and playtest your own prototype, live.

**Hosted by:** Riemer van Rozen and Daria (Dasha) Protsenko

**Preparation:** Bring your own laptop and download Vie in advance:
