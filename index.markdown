**Live Game Design** has the potential to provide powerful, accessible, and standardized solutions for authoring, prototyping, and playtesting games for everyone. However, currently, tools still lack intuitive user interfaces and real-time feedback mechanisms for rapid design iterations. Designers of all experience levels need immediate feedback and suggestions (feed-forward) on how changes to rules and content affect dynamics and gameplay.

**The Live Game Design workshop** brings together researchers, designers, and educators who develop, apply, and teach these tools. Together, we will explore how better tools can empower creators, accelerate prototyping, support education, and make game design more engaging, intuitive, and alive. The workshop will feature an industry keynote by Joris Dormans, a hands-on mini game jam suitable for beginners, and an interactive panel discussion.

# Venue
The Live Game Design workshop is co-located with the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 2025), organized in Vienna and Graz. [http://fdg2025.org](http://fdg2025.org)
* **Date:** April 15th 2025

# Activities
The workshop will host three types of activities.

## 1. **Keynote by Joris Dormans**

**Bio.** Joris Dormans is the founder of indie game company Ludomotion that is renowned for its state-of-the-art content generation in its roguelike-ish titles Unexplored 1 and 2. One day a week he stays in touch with his academic roots as an assistant professor involved with the Game Studies minor at the humanities department of Leiden University. 

**Generative Progress.** Since I decided to favor indie game development over a predominantly academic career almost 10 years ago, I have had the opportunity to put all those fancy content generation techniques into practice. Looking back at those years of development I am surprised how little I changed to the core techniques. At the same time, I have become much more bold in the way I am using the techniques. Over the years I have found that, when leveraged in the right way, the value of content generation is in its affordance for radically different game designs.

## 2. **Mini Game Jam**

In a mini game jam on Live Game Design for novices, 
you will experiment with Vie.
Vie is a powerful tool for rapid game prototyping
that provides real-time feedback on game mechanics.
Receive a short demo, create your own prototype, and playtest it live!

**Preparation:** Please bring your own laptop, and download Vie here:

## 3. **Panel Discussion**
Explore challenges in game design, programming education, and future tools, 
with insights from industry leaders and academics. The discussion will cover:
* Applying game design and development tools in practice.
* Teaching game design and digital prototyping to students and novices.
* Creating live, AI-assisted, and visual programming tools for game design.

Educating novices in the art of game design is a key challenge in computer science education. To develop their skills, novices need feedback to understand the impact of changes to digital game prototypes. However, game design tools lack intuitive mechanisms for visualizing how changes affect dynamics and gameplay. As a result, forming mental models about cause-and-effect relationships is hard, and learning how to program can be tedious and frustrating. The Live Game Design workshop 
**The Live Game Design workshop** brings together researchers, practitioners, and educators who develop and apply game design tools. Together, we explore how better tools can empower creators, accelerate prototyping, support education, and make design more engaging, intuitive, and live.
